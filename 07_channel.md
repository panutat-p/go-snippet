# Channel

## Preemptive vs Cooperative
> Preemption refers to the ability of the Go runtime scheduler to interrupt a running goroutine and switch the execution to a different goroutine.

> Go routines are managed by the Go runtime's scheduler, this scheduler is not preemptive in the traditional sense.
> Go's scheduler is cooperative, meaning it only checks whether it should switch goroutines at certain points in the program,
> such as function calls, channel operations, and blocking system calls.

> Starting from Go 1.14, the runtime has introduced asynchronous preemption to prevent long-running goroutines from monopolizing the processor, making the scheduler more "preemptive".

> Unlike Java, threads are managed by the operating system's thread scheduler, which uses a preemptive scheduling algorithm.
> a preemptive scheduler will forcibly interrupt a running task after a fixed time slice.
> this scheduler can forcibly interrupt a running thread to give another thread a chance to run.

## FIFO queue

```go
func main() {
    var (
        ch = make(chan int, 10)
        wg sync.WaitGroup
    )
    
    wg.Add(2)

    go func ()  {
        for i := 1; i < 11; i++ {
            ch <- i
        }
        fmt.Println("positive producer complete")
        wg.Done()
    }()

    go func ()  {
        for i := -1; i > -11; i-- {
            ch <- i
        }
        fmt.Println("negative producer complete")
        wg.Done()
    }()

    go func() {
        wg.Wait()
        fmt.Println("âœ… done")
        close(ch)
    }()

    // Read from the channel until it's closed
    for v := range ch {
        fmt.Println(v)
    }
}
```
